# ROUTER1X3
Routing allows messages to travel from one computer to another and ultimately reach the target device. It is the act of transporting a packet of data from source to destination. A router is a networking device that is placed at gateways—the locations where two or more networks connect—that sends data packets across computer networks, typically between two LANs, WANs, or a LAN and its ISP's network. It is a routing device at OSI layer 3. It uses the address fields in the packet header to direct an incoming packet to an output channel.
Routers are useful in many contexts, such as large-scale enterprise networks, households, and enterprises. They are vital parts of other wide-area networks including the internet.It complies with the four-layer TCP/IP protocol. The Physical layer is also made up of the Application, Transport, Network, and MAC layers.

A router transfers data in the form of data packets; a device cannot transfer raw data.

The router data packet format is as follows:

Format of a packet:

The payload can range in length from 3 to 65 bytes, and the packet is composed of three parts: the header, payload, and parity. Each element has an 8-bit width.
